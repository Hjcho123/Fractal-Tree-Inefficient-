# An Inefficient Fractal Tree Generator
A simple fractal tree program I made in Python. The code is a bit of a mess, and so I plan on making a better fractal tree generator someday using a proper [L-systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L-system?useskin=vector) based approach. But for now, just wanted to share this!

### Sample Images

Some of the Images above have the code slightly tweaked. For example, this one above had the code tweaked so that the main "stem" of the plant was not automatically set to be pointing directly upwards.
